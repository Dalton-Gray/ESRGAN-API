## Single Image Super-Resolution with ESRGAN


### Overview
This project uses modern deep learning tools and techniques to create a web application capable of enhancing the resolution of an image presented to it by a user.

There are many potential use cases for an image upscaling application, image-based medical diagnosis, earth-observation remote sensing, astronomical observation, biometric observation, and general photo and video enhancement just to name a few. This upscaling web service produced by this project will focus primarily on upscaling generic photographs, but the tools investigated and developed here could easily be adapted to work for any of the other use cases I listed.
